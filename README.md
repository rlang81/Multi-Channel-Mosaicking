# Multi-Channel-Mosaicking
Public repository for multi-channel mosaicking algorithm, as described in JBO publication: https://doi.org/10.1117/1.JBO.24.12.126002.
Written in Matlab R2019a (Mathworks). 

Included in this repository is an implementation of graph-cut based stitching, as done by Kose et al., which greatly increases the quality of mosaics. This implementation is based on a Matlab wrapper by Shai Bagon:

The graph-cut based stitching is under patent protection. In order to use the code and algorithm for research purposes, please include the following citations in any publications.

### 1) Install

Clone the repository and run compile_gc.m (in GCmex2.0 directory) to build the MEX libraries and enable graph-cut based stitching.

### 2) Usage and File Descriptions

**Files**

Test_Mosaic.m - Test "main" program to show mosaicking capabilities, accesses data from "Test_Data" directory

mchannel_nxcorr_reg_GPU.m - Function for cross-correlation based m-channel mosaicking alignment/registration

Frame_Blend.m & stitchImages.m - Functions for implementing Kose's graph-cut based stitching

**Directories**

GCmex2.0 - Matlab wrapper by Shai Bagon that implements graph-cut minimization

Test_Data - Contains some test images for showing mosaicking capabilities. Each sub-folder in this directory will be treated as a data channel, and within each sub-directory should be an equal number of sequential images labelled "frame#.tif", where the # is replaced by the image number tag starting at 0. The test data only mosaics 2 images - there is no theoretical limit to the number of possible sequential images, it is constrained by system memory.
